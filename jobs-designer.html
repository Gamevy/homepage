        <h1>A REAL Designer</h1>
        <h2>TL;DR: We need a designer who’s brilliant and does everything.</h2>

        <p>We like designers with passion and pride – who are restless, always searching, always improving, never satisfied when others say ‘it’s fine’ but who also understands the trade-offs demanded by business pressures.</p>

        <h3>What would you be designing?</h3>
        <p>A game. From start to finish. No concept artist. Maybe a 3D specialist.</p>
        <p>You’d be thrashing out the idea with the product owner. No-one expects you to delve into the maths, but you are expected to comment when something feels too slow or too complex or lacking fun. And if that means redesigning how the game works (rather than just how it looks), that’s what it means.</p>
        <p>You’d be finding the perfect expression of the idea – what we sometimes call the ‘narrative’ in design terms. And while it would fit within our ‘world of gameshows’, gameshows are a fairly elastic genre.</p>
        <p>You’d be working on the UX and how a player interacts with the game. You’d be crafting moments of celebration and tension – and by crafting we mean everything from winning animations to music, from board layout to instant feedback.</p>
        <p>Nothing’s beneath your attention. Creating a hundred sprites is not the most exciting part of your week but it’s as important a part of launching the game out there as sketching a logo or an app icon. And launching the game is your job.</p>

        <h3>Skills and Experience</h3>
        <p>The bullet point bit. If you have all this – great. If not, but you are the kind of designer we describe above – don’t be put off.</p>
